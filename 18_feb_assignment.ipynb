It relies on a client-server model, where the client sends requests to the server, and the server responds with the requested data in a specific data format, such as JSON or XML. REST services use uniform resource identifiers (URIs) to identify and access resources on the server.\\n\\nSOAP Architecture:\\nSOAP is a protocol that defines the XML-based message format and the rules for exchanging messages between systems.
